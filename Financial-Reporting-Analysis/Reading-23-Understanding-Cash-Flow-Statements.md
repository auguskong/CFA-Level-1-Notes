## 基础词汇/概念

## Notes
Indirect Method 和 Direct Method的本质区别是什么? 

Direct Method是每一笔都列出来? presents the firm's operating cash receipts and payments,  -> 优点: 更具体的数据

Direct: 一收入四支出 简单 直观
收入: 
* Customer 
支出:
* Supplier: C&GS
* SG&A 员工工资
* Interest 
* Tax


Indirect Method是最后只得 到一个结果? presents the net result of these receipts and payments -> 优点: focus on the difference between net income and operating cash flow. This provides a useful link to the income statement when forecasting future operating cash flow
可以看出net income和cash flow 

Indirect Method 三步走: NI(净利润) 经过三步调整变为CFO  从净利润出发
1. 找到Net Income 调整非现金收入和支出  加会折旧 
2. 调整非经营项目 比如 Fixed Asset的处理 Gain/Loss不是operation 的
3. 调整B/S Working Capital = Current Asset - Current Liability  
    * A/R 多收的钱 是资产 减出去
    * Inventory 买的存货 是资产 减出去
    * A/P  别人给你的钱  是负债 需要加回来 
    * Wage Payable 欠员工的工资 是负债 需要加回来
    * ... 其他的某些项目 


什么是reconcile net income to cash flow from operating activities. 

直接法和间接法只针对于CFO 

资产对于现金流是 减掉 End - Begin > 0 的时候标志资产增长了 资产是要花钱买才能增加的
负债对于现金流是 增加


收到的钱: Net sale + A/R 讨债要回来的钱(A/R 减少的就是讨债讨回来的)
付给供应商的: purchase + 

COGS 是主营业务收入 欠别人的钱减少量 等于自己要还的钱多了  存货的增加表现在 COGS包括了折旧+存货 
存货的增加表示付给供应商的钱增加了  只算purchase 也就是新买的货  需要找期初的数据



#### CFO（Cash Flow from Operating Activities)

Operating activities: 
* day-to-day activities
* buy/sell dealing securities or trading securities

CFO 是会影响到net income的
| Inflow | Outflow |
| --- | --- |
| Cash from customers | Cash paid to employees and suppliers |
| Sale proceeds from trading securities | Acquisition of trading securities |
| Interested received | Interest paid |
| Dividend received | Taxes paid |
|  | Cash paid for other expenses |
#### CFF (Cash Flow from Financial Activities)
Financing activities:
* obtain/pay capital, such as equity and long-term debt
* issue stock or bonds 

| Inflow | Outflow |
| --- | --- |
| Principal amounts of debt issued | Principal paid on debt |
| Proceeds from issuing stocks | Payments to reacquire stock |
#### CFI (Cash Flow from Investing Activities)
Investing activies: 
* purchaseing and selling long-term assets and non-trading securities

| Inflow | Outflow |
| --- | --- |
| Sale proceeds from fixed assets | Acquisition of fixed assets |
| Sale proceeds from debt & equity invetments | Acquisition of debt & equity investments |
| Principal received from loans made to others | Loans made to others|


Assets 增加 = Cash 减少
Liability 增加 = Cash 增加
看Notes上的例题 P90 


USGAAP vs. IFRS Comparison
| Items | US GAAP | IFRS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest received | CFO | CFO / CFI |
| Dividends received | CFO | CFO / CFI |
| Interest paid | CFO | CFO / CFF |
| Taxes | CFO | CFO / CFI / CFF 不同活动区分一下 |
| Pay Dividends | CFF | CFO / CFF |

美国准则下 pay dividends 是Financing activities

国际准则下 付钱(利息+股利) 都是Financing activities, 收钱(利息+股利) 都是Invest activities


Non-cash transactions, if significant, are reported as supplementary information, not in the investing or financing sections of the cash flow statement. 比如 convertible bond, in exchange for capital assets

现金流的decrease / increase 需要考虑方向


不同方法的优缺点: 

direct method
直接按照cash receipts / payments来计算 provide information on the specific sources or operating cash receipts and payments

indirect method: 从net income 来转换
* shows the reasons for differences between net income and operating cash flows
* mirror a forecasting approach future income
* 做账 准备起来更简单


Cash Received = Net sales - $\Delta$ Account Receivable  A/R 增加表示有人赊账没有真的收到现金，需要从Net sales里面减掉 

Purchase = COGS + $\Delta$ Account Payable A/P增加表示我们赊账，需要加上

Common-Size Analysis 是以Net Revenue作分母来计算的

FCFF = NI + NCC + Int(1 - Tax rate) - FCInv - WCInv

FCFF: free cash flow to the firm 
NI: net income
NCC: Non-cash charges
Int: Interest expense
FCInv = Capital expenditures(fixed capital, e.g. equipment)
WCInv = Working capital expenditures


CFO = NI + NCC - WCInv 
CFO: cash flow from operating

FCFE = CFO - FCInv + Net borrowing
FCFE: free cash flow to the equity  考虑股东的利益
