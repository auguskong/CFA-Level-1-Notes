Measurement of Financial Statement Elements


position:
* Assests
* Liabilities
* Equity

performance:
* Income
* Expenses

Two Assumptions:
* Accrual accounting: reflect transactions in the period when they actually occur, not necessarily when cash movements occur.
* Going concern: the company will continue in business for the foreseeable future. 

Measurement of financial elements:
* Historical cost: amount originally paid for the asset
* Amortized cost: Historical cost adjusted for depreciation, amortization, depletion, and impairment
* Current cost: the amount the firm would have to pay today for the same asset
* Realizable value: amount for which the firm could sell the asset or settlement of obligation
* Present value: The discounted value of the asset's expected future cash flows
* Fair value: The amount at which two knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction would exchange the asset


Faithful representation: complete(all information necessary is depicted) + neutral(without bias) + free from error(no errors of commissions or omission in the description)

IASB conceptual framework:
* Comparability: 可以进行横向比较
* Verifiability: 可以验证
* Timeliness: 及时有效
* Understandability: 简单容易理解

IFRS: Principles-based approach: provide broad framework without specific guideline, requires considerable judgments
US GAAP: Rule-based approach: Sets rules for the record of every single transaction -> objectives-oriented approach: priciples + rule
